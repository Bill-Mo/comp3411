1.
The relations are {Person, Membership, Coach, Member, TrainingClass, MemberJoin, Attend}. FDs are Person->(Coach, Member), TrainingClass->(Coach), (Member, Membership)->MemberJoin, (Member, TrainingClass)->Attend. The key is (Person, TrainingClass, MemberJoin). All FDs violate BCNF, so it is not in BCNF.

A.
(1). The attributes are ABCDEFGH. FDs are A->BCD, B->H, C->DE, E->F. The key is AG. A->BCD violates BCNF, LHS is partial key, so partition
(2a). The attributes are ABCD. FD is A->BCD. The key is A. No FD violate BCNF, so ABC is part of solution
(2b).The attributes are AEFG. FD is E->F. The key is AEG. E->F violates BCNF, LHS is partial key, so partition
(3a). The attributes are EF. FD is E->F. The key is E. No FD violate BCNF, so EF is part of solution
(3b).The attributes are AG. No FDs. The key is AG. No FD violate BCNF, so AG is part of solution
Solution: ABCD, EF, AG.

B.
(1). The attributes are ABCDEFGH. FDs are A->CH, D->EG, B->F. The key is ABD. A->CH violates BCNF, LHS is partial key, so partition
(2a). The attributes are ACH. FD is A->CH. The key is A. No FD violate BCNF, so ACH is part of solution
(2b).The attributes are ABDEFG. FDs are D->EG, B->F. The key is ABD.  D->EG violates BCNF, LHS is partial key, so partition
(3a). The attributes are DEG. FD is D->EG. The key is D. No FD violate BCNF, so DEG is part of solution
(3b).The attributes are ABDF. FD is B->F. The key is ABD.  B->F violates BCNF, LHS is partial key, so partition
(4a). The attributes are BF. FD is B->F. The key is B. No FD violate BCNF, so BF is part of solution
(4b).The attributes are AD. No FDs. The key is AD.  No FD violate BCNF, so AD is part of solution
Solution: ACH, DEG, BF, AD.

C.
(1). The attributes are ABCDEFGH. FDs are ABC->D, D->EH, F->ADG. The key is BCF. ABC->D violates BCNF, LHS is not a key, so partition
(2a). The attributes are ABCD. FD is ABC->D. The key is ABC. No FD violate BCNF, so ABCD is part of solution
(2b).The attributes are ABCEFGH. FD is F->AG. The key is BCEFH.  F->AG violates BCNF, LHS is partial key, so partition
(3a). The attributes are AFG. FD is F->AG. The key is F. No FD violate BCNF, so AFG is part of solution
(3b).The attributes are BCEFH. No FDs. The key is BCEFH. No FD violate BCNF, so BCEFH is part of solution
Solution: ABCD, AFG, BCEFH.
